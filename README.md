## SmartHome Energy Management System
Full self-sufficient system containing smart home energy simulation as REST API. <br>

### Steps to run app in developer mode

First you need to configure .env file. Example .env-example is included. <br>
<br>
In folder with docker-compose.yml run the following commands: <br>
`docker-compose build` to install all requirements <br>
